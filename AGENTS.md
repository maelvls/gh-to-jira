Code comments must end with a dot like any sentence would. When using JSON, use encoding/json/v2, not encoding/json; don't forget to do 'export GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2' when running Go commands.

When commiting, both provide a title AND a body to the commit that explains why this change was made and how to use it if needed.
